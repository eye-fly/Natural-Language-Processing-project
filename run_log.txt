Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

Game Description:
In this game, there are two players:
• The Defuser (you): Sees the bomb's current module 'screen' but not the manual.
• The Manual Expert: Has access to the defusal manual but not the bomb's display.
Players must collaborate by exchanging text instructions to solve each module.
The goal is to disarm all modules before time runs out or the bomb explodes.
Each module has specific rules that must be followed precisely.
Communication is key - the defuser must clearly describe what they see,
and the expert must provide clear instructions based on the manual.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

Game Description:
In this game, there are two players:
• The Defuser (you): Sees the bomb's current module 'screen' but not the manual.
• The Manual Expert: Has access to the defusal manual but not the bomb's display.
Players must collaborate by exchanging text instructions to solve each module.
The goal is to disarm all modules before time runs out or the bomb explodes.
Each module has specific rules that must be followed precisely.
Communication is key - the defuser must clearly describe what they see,
and the expert must provide clear instructions based on the manual.
